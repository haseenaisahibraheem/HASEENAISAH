    <h2>On the situation in Ukraine</h2>
    <p style="width: 800px;">
      For those of you who haven't heard, Russia's military began its invasion of Ukraine on
      Thursday, February 25th, after previously insisting that they wouldn't. (It happened mostly due to tensions rising between Russia and Ukraine due to the possibility of Ukraine joining <a href="https://nato.int" target="_blank">NATO</a>, and also deep-rooted resentment with Russia's government believing Ukrainian land was rightfully theirs.)<a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/02/26/russias-invasion-of-ukraine" target="_blank" style="font-size: 10px; vertical-align: super;">[1]</a> 
    </p>
    <br />
    <p style="width: 800px;">
      Many nations around the world have condemned these actions. Many worry
      that if President Vladimir Putin continues his rampage a third World War
      could begin (although it's unlikely).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p style="width: 800px;">
      But the most terrifying bit of this is thinking about the people. It’s
      easy to desensitize yourself from the numbers, the graphs, casualties
      rising by the day. But these are people. Behind every number is a person.
      A person who had a family, a person who had hopes and inspirations, a person
      who laughed and cried and loved just like you do. It’s easy to think that
      the people in danger are just some people over there, but they are people
      just like you.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p style="width: 800px;">
      We aren’t asking you to fly to Ukraine and singlehandedly fight away the
      bad guys, and we sure as hell aren’t asking you to sign a “stop the war”
      change.org petition that Vladimir Putin won’t care about. The best
      way you can help is by doing one (or both) of two things.

        >
        to support the people on the ground there. They’re working to help
        Ukrainians inside and outside of Ukraine, as they’re in critical need of shelter,
        basic aid items, and medical supplies. It would really be awesome if you
        were able to convince your parents to donate even a little bit, anything
        helps. But if not, (which is perfectly understandable), you can always 
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Share this page or the Red Cross link to get the word out and get the
        people of Ukraine the support they need. Many apologies for interrupting
        your gaming, have a great day.

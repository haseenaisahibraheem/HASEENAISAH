    <h2>INCEPTION</h2>
    <p>
      On November 3rd, 2021, the majority of the popular "unblockedgames" sites
      were, (ironically), blocked on MMS computers. The creators of PLAYHYDRA
      set out to port many of its most popular games to a new site. As is the
      tale of the hydra, if you chop off one of its heads, two more will take
      its place. PLAYHYDRA will simply move to a new location (coincidentally)
      whenever it is inevitably blocked. New locations will be found in the
      <a href="location.html">LOCATION</a> section of this site after it is
      blocked (just use a non-chromebook to check the page).
    </p>
    <!-- all of the requests were overwhelming -->
    <!-- <h2>REQUEST GAMES</h2>
    <p>
      Feel free to suggest games to be added at
      <a href="mailto:playhydrarequests@gmail.com">our email</a>.

      <strong>do not promote, condone, or support</strong> the misuse of school
      devices. The creators of PLAYHYDRA <strong>cannot and will not</strong> be
